## Projects
### Amazon Sentiment Analysis Reviews
This project analyzes sentiments on CDs and Vinyl products on Amazon's website using Natural Language Processing. This notebook uses the pre-trained VADER sentiment classifier to identify positive and negative tweets. Further, supervised machine learning algorithms i.e. logistic regression, naive Bayes, random forests, support vector classifier, and neural networks are used for the classification of the reviews.
