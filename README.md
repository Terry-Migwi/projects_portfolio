## About Me 

I am a data scientist with 5 years of experience working with data — having worked both as a data science coach/mentor and as a practitioner in industry. My general interest lies in exploring and analyzing both tabular and text data to uncover actionable insights for businesses. I enjoy automating repetitive tasks to save time and boost efficiency. Whether I am mentoring others or building solutions myself, my goal is always the same — to make data useful, accessible, and impactful.

## Technical Skills
Statistical Analysis, Data Analysis, Data Visualization, supervised and unsupervised Machine Learning, Deep Learning

**Tools: Python, SQL, SPSS, AWS, Power BI, Git.**

## Projects 

### [Attendance Tracking Project](https://github.com/Terry-Migwi/Attendance-Tracking)

This project was developed to automate the learner attendance tracking process to save time. Previously, marking attendance manually for approximately 100 learners took me about 30 minutes per session. With two sessions per week, that added up to 2 hours of repetitive work every week. To streamline this task, I created a Python script that now completes the process in under 5 minutes.

How it works:
1. I maintain a spreadsheet with all learners' names and email addresses.
2. After each session, I receive a separate spreadsheet with the emails of attendees.
3. The script compares the two files, identifies absentees, and generates a separate spreadsheet listing them.

This output simplifies the process of updating the attendance system—especially since it defaults to marking everyone as present.

Results:
1. Reduced attendance tracking time from 2 hours/week to under 10 minutes/week
2. Eliminated redundant manual tasks
3. Created a reliable and repeatable workflow for future sessions

### [Airbnb Price Prediction](https://github.com/Terry-Migwi/Airbnb_Price_Prediction)

This project employs statistical and machine learning techniques to predict Airbnb prices in the City of Paris. Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines(linear kernel), and multi-layer perceptron (linear activation) models are used to explore linear patterns between variables and non-linear and ensemble models, namely, Support Vector Machine (polynomial, RBF kernel), Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), eXtreme Gradient Boosting Machines (xGBoost) are used to explore more complex patterns between the variables. This study shows the potential of machine learning in understanding complex relationships in data and predicting Airbnb prices.

### [Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Reviews](https://github.com/Terry-Migwi/Amazon_Reviews_Sentiment_Analysis)

This project analyzes sentiments on CDs and Vinyl products on Amazon's website using Natural Language Processing. The pre-trained VADER sentiment classifier is used to identify positive, neutral, and negative reviews for the products. Further, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Random Forests supervised machine learning and Neural Networks are used to classify the reviews. This study is relevant for Amazon's product team to evaluate their product performance, better understand their customers' needs and inform strategy.

### [Customer Analytics](https://github.com/Terry-Migwi/Customer-Segmentation)

Customer segmentation project using K-Means clustering and Hierarchical clustering on customer data of Kira Plastinina, a Russian brand, to determine the characteristics of different customers and understand the behaviours of different customer groups. This study is relevant to Kira Plastinina's marketing team to understand their target market better, employ targeted communication, and tailor campaigns for the different customer segments.
